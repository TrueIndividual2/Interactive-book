		<span class="chapter-title">Chapter 9: JSON</span>

		<span>
			JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight, platform independent, data interchange format. Most
			often used for sending data to/from server. Basic syntax includes name/value pairs in double quotes separated by colon.
			If more than one name/value pair exists, they are separated by comma. JSON is in text format and when exchanging data
			between a browser and a server, the data can only be in text format. Benefits are that JSON data format is supported
			by far most of programming/scripting languages.
		</span>

		<span>JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford.</span>

		<span class="notice">NOTE: JSON format requires use of name/value pairs to be enclosed in double quotes (")</span>

		<span>Example: "name":"value","name1":"value1"</span>

<pre class="no-style">
&bull; Data is in name/value pairs
&bull; Data is separated by commas
&bull; Curly braces hold objects
&bull; Square brackets hold arrays
&bull; File type for JSON files is ".json" and MIME type is "application/json"

So a JSON data that holds object called "myObject", member variable "name" and array "colors":

</pre>

<pre><code>{
    "myObject":{"name":"john", "colors":["green","red"] }
}
</code></pre>

		<span>Another example, JSON received text data that contains simple data values</span>

<pre><code>{
    "name":"McGuyver","age":30,"pro":true
}
</code></pre>

		<span>JavaScript offers class with methods to easily convert JSON text data to JavaScript object.</span>

<pre><code>JSON.stringify(myObject); // Converts object into JSON string
JSON.parse(myObject);     // Converts JSON string into a JavaScript object
</code></pre>

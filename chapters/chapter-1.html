      <span class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: About JavaScript tutorial for programmers</span>


      <span>This tutorial is written for programmers who have prior experience of some programming or scripting language and want to learn
            JavaScript syntax. I will be comparing JavaScript syntax to other common programming/scripting languages syntaxes throughout this
            tutorial (like C++ or PHP for example) and because of this approach, this tutorial is not suitable for beginners without 
            general knowledge of programming.</span>

      <span>I started writing this tutorial because I was updating my own JavaScript skills and after looking at my vast amount of notes that
            I have gathered in past years, I made a decision; why not convert them to a tutorial -style book and share my knowledge with the
            rest of the world. This is the interactive version of my tutorial and requires a web browser and JavaScript permission from your
            browser to view and function properly. You can also view this tutorial with your smartphone or tablet as I have made this also
            mobile friendly.</span>

      <span>For this tutorial, I have chosen ECMAScript (edition) 6 or known as other names: ES6 and ECMAScript 2015. Reason for this is that
            the time I am writing this book, ES6 is widely accepted and impelemented in almost all modern browsers.</span>

      <span>This tutorial will teach basics of JavaScript language syntax, some advanced features language has to offer and how to avoid common
            pitfalls. Some of the functionality that can be achieved using HTML or CSS (like responsive fonts) are intentionally implemented with
            JavaScript for syntax learning purposes.</span>

      <span>This tutorial also includes how to use browsers debugging tools and some other things that might step out of scope of JavaScript syntax
            but are good to know for web developer. You can also use this tutorial as a cheat sheet for ECMAScript 6. By the end of this tutorial
            book, you should have familiarized yourself with common concepts of using basic JavaScript syntax without any external libraries or
            frameworks.</span>

      <span>With basic knowledge of JavaScript syntax, I did create my own small framework with pure JavaScript for this tutorial and also so that
            I can use it to release interactive versions of other topics in the future easily. You can always check the main JavaScript file to
            see how I implemented it.</span>

      <span><b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic understanding of programming in general, basics of HTML and CSS syntax, web browser with JavaScript enabled and
            optionally cookies allowed for storing settings.</span>

      <span>Tested with following browers: [List of browsers and their versions]</span>

      <span>I have been involved in ICT since childhood and my thirst for knowledge has given me good skills, especially for this field.
            I consider myself as a real programmer but I got a job which involved making web applications so i started focusing more and
            more to web developing. After reading and assimilating the basics of web developing languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and
            server side requirements for web applications including relational database (MySQL) and server side scripting language (PHP),
            I wrote my first webshop and a cash register system.</span>

      <span>I have been a web developer over 10+ years and have also used Content Management Systems like Joomla, Drupal, WordPress etc.</span>

      <span>Even though I am interested in wide range of IT areas including making apps with Java language for Android,
            reverse engineering, security field, building computers from components etc. this book is for learning basic JavaScript syntax.</span>

      <span>This is also a good opportunity for me to practise my written English skills (English is not my native language)
            and creating a tutorial format book from my notes and knowledge. All questions, improvement ideas and noticing typos or otherwise bad
            English, is more than welcome and can be send to my e-mail address that you can find from the left side menu bar using info icon
            (or just reading included JavaScript file's header comment information).</span>

      <span>As last words, I usually compare programming (or scripting) to cars. Car has intention: to get you from place A to B.
            Programs also have an intention. You can build a car from scratch with parts or use already made car. If you have knowledge
            to understand how your car parts work, you can create your own car or customize your existing one to be more suitable for
            your needs. So with this analogy, I design and build cars, choose right parts and motor for it but I don't do the paint
            job for the car which is a profession of it's own. That is a nice way to compare my ugly UI which leaves no doubt that I did
            not have a graphics designer for this project ;)</span>

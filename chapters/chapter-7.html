		<span class="chapter-title">Chapter 7: Document Object Model (HTML DOM)</span>


		<span>
			When a web page is loaded, browser creates a HTML Document Object Model of the web page. HTML DOM is one of three W3C
			(World Wide Web Consortium) DOM standards (other two are "Core DOM" and "XML DOM"). HTML DOM model is a tree of objects
			where root object is "document" and all HTML elements are objects that belong to it. With JavaScript, you can modify,
			remove or add HTML elements in a web page dynamically. In other words, HTML DOM is a programming interface for HTML.
		</span>

		<span>
			The document object represents your web page. If you want to access any element in the HTML page, you start with accessing
			the document object.
		</span>

		<span>With document object, you can: find, add, remove or modify HTML elements and create event handlers.</span>

      <span class="notice">NOTE: Good JavaScript programming practice is to wait for browser to fully load HTML DOM before trying to
								                 access HTML DOM elements. This can be achieved with pure JavaScript by using following code snippet:
		  </span>

    <code><span>
      document.onreadystatechange = function() {<br />
        if(document.readyState == 'complete' ) {<br />
          // Place your code here<br />
        }<br />
      };
    </code></span>

    <span><b>OR</b></span>

    <code><span>
      window.onload = function() {<br />
        // Place your code here<br />
      }
    </span></code>

		<span>window.onload fires right after document -objects readyState -membervariable equals 'complete'</span>

		<span class="chapter-section-title">Accessing HTML elements</span>


    <span>Before you can do anything with HTML element, you must first access it by getting instance of it. There are a couple of ways to do this:</span>

    <span>&bull; Finding HTML elements by id<br />
                  document.getElementById("myID");<br />
                  Returns HTML element object<br />
          &bull; Finding HTML elements by tag name
                  document.getElementsByTagName("div");<br />
                  Returns HTMLCollection object<br />
          &bull; Finding HTML elements by class name<br />
                  document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");<br />
                  Returns HTMLCollection object<br />
          &bull; Finding HTML element by CSS selectors<br />
                  document.querySelector(".myId");<br />
                  Returns first <i>Element</i> withing the document with given selector. If no matches are found, returns null<br />
          &bull; Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors<br />
                  document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");<br />
                  Returns HTMLCollection object including all elements with class "myClass"<br /><br />

          After you have HTML element object, you can access its properties/methods. For example, changing a CSS 
          style of one DIV in HTML document:</span>

    <code><span>
      var myDiv = document.getElementById("myID");<br />
      myDiv.style.backgroundColor = "#000000";
    </span></code>

		<span>
			If you use one of the documents find methods that return HTMLCollection object, you can access a single element
			in the same way you would access an array element. For example, finding all HTML Div elements that have a class
			"myDIV" and changing their text:
		</span>

    <code><span>
      var myDivs = document.getElementsByClassName("myDIV");<br />
      var i = 0;<br />
      var divCount = myDivs.length;<br /><br />

      for(i = 0; i < divCount; i++ ) {<br />
        myDivs[i].innerHTML = "This text was changed dynamically by JavaScript";<br />
      }
    </span></code>


		<span class="chapter-sub-title">HTML DOM Events</span>


    <span>You can use JavaScript to react HTML events. HTML Event can be something that browser or user does in web page. For example:<br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>An HTML web page has finished loading</li>
        <li>User clicks the mouse</li>
        <li>Mouse moves over the element</li>
        <li>User strokes a key</li>
        <li>A HTML input field has changed</li>
      </ul>

    <span>Events can be written in the HTML document itself including event attribute to tag:</span>

    <code><span>
      HTML File:<br /><br />
      &lt;div&gt;<br />
      &lt;p onclick="writeToConsole()"&gt;Click me&lt;/p&gt;<br />
      &lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />
      &lt;script&gt;<br />
      function writeToConsole() {<br />
        console.log('P element clicked');<br />
      }<br />
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </span></code>

      <span class="notice">NOTE: If we use any of HTML elements event attribute, you have to have function declared in the same HTML file
                           inside &lt;script&gt; tags.</span>

    <span>Events can also be added dynamically with JavaScript:</span>

    <code><span>
      document.getElementById("myDiv").onmouseover = writeToConsole;<br /><br />

      function writeToConsole() {<br />
        console.log('Mouse is over HTML element that has id myDiv');<br />
      }
    </span></code>

    <span>
      JavaScript propagates events in HTML DOM using either event bubbling or event capturing. Event propagation means in which order
      should the event be handled. If we have element inside an element and both have mouseclick event attached to it, bubbling means
      that inner most elements event handler is executed first, while capturing does the opposite (ie. outer most element's event 
      handler is executed first). To control even propagation, we can use elements "addEventListener" method:</span>

    <span>&bullet; addEventListener(event, function, [options,useCapture])<br />
    Description:    Attach event listener function to HTML element<br />
    Parameters:     event - String<br />
                      Event that we want to attach to HTML element.<br /></span>


          <span class="notice">NOTE: When adding event, we don't use the "on" prefix for the event like we would use in HTML. So
                            "onmouseclick" becomes "mouseclick".</span>
    <span>function - String<br />
                      Name of the function to execute when the event fires<br />
                    options (optional) - Object<br />
                      If given, takes object that specifies characteristics of the event listener. Avalaible options are:<br />
                        capture: Boolean indicating that events of this type will be dispatched to the registered
                                 listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath the DOM tree.<br />
                        once:    Boolean indicating that the listener function to execute should be run only once
                                 after being added. If set to true, the listener will be automatically removed when
                                 invoked.<br />
                        passive: Boolean that handles elements default behaviour. If set to to true and function to
                                 execute after event fires, calls preventDefault() method, a console warning will be
                                 issued.<br />
                    useCapture (optional) - boolean<br />
                      If set to true, event uses capturing propagation. If set to false, event uses bubbling propagation.
                      If options parameter is not given and boolean is given as a third argument, this argument takes
                      priority. Defaults to false ie. bubbling propagation.<br />

    Return value:   undefined<br /><br />

    Example usage when clicked twice:</span>

    <code><span>
      HTML file:<br /><br />

      &lt;div id="myDiv"&gt;<br />
        &lt;p id="myP">Click me&lt;/p&gt;<br />
      &lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />

      JavaScript file:<br /><br />

      document.getElementById('myDiv').addEventListener('click', writeToConsole, true);<br />
      document.getElementById('myP').addEventListener('click', writeToConsole, {once: true}, true);<br /><br />

      function writeToConsole() {<br />
        console.log(this.id);<br />
      }<br /><br />

      Console output:<br />
      &nbsp;myDiv<br />
      &nbsp;myP<br />
      &nbsp;myDiv
    </span></code>

    <span>By default, you cannot pass parameters to function which is executed when event fires. If you want to pass parameters to 
          function, you can use following example:</span>

    <code><span>
      function writeToConsole(text = "") {<br />
        return function() {<br />
          console.log(text);<br />
        }<br />
      }<br /><br />

      document.getElementById('myDiv').addEventListener('click', writeToConsole('Paramater passed'));
    </span></code>

    <span>Commonly used events:<br />
      onchange      - An HTML element has been changed<br />
      onclick       - The user clicks an HTML element<br />
      onmouseover   - The user moves mouse over an HTML element<br />
      onmouseout    - The user moves mouse away from an HTML element<br />
      onload        - The browser has finished loading the web page<br />
      onchange      - The event occurs when the content of a form element, the selection, or the checked state have changed (for &lt;input&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and &lt;textarea&gt;)<br />
      onkeydown     - The event occurs when the user is pressing a key<br /><br />

      Events can have properties and methods also:<br />
      preventDefault()   - Cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur<br />
      screenX            - Returns the horizontal coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the screen, when an event was triggered<br />
      target             - Returns the element that triggered the event<br /><br /></span>

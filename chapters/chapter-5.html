		<span class="chapter-title">Chapter 5: JavaScript Classes</span>

		<span>
			In other object oriented programming/scripting languages, you usually define class and then create an object from it.
			JavaScript on the other hand, is classless language. With ES6, JavaScript now supports creating "classes" with new
			keywords: <b><i>class</i></b>, <b><i>super</i></b>, <b><i>extends</i></b>, <b><i>static</i></b> and a method for class
			constructor called <b><i>constructor()</i></b>. Because JavaScript inheritance works by prototype chain in objects and
			not through classes, adding new keywords and functionality that emulates classes is mainly syntactical sugar for those
			that have used to have classes in object oriented languages.
		</span>

		<span>
			Before ES6, you could emulate classes by creating a function that acts as a constructor to new Object. Using keyword
			<b><i>this</i></b> inside function, our function acts like a class.
		</span>

		<span class="notice">NOTE: Below example includes ES6 syntax with setting default values to function parameters if not
							       provided when creating new object instance with "new" keyword.</span>

<pre><code>function Car(model = 'lada', color = 'red') {
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
    this.getCarInfo = getCarInfoOutside;
    this.setCarInfo = function(model = this.model, color) {
        this.model = model, this.color = color;
    }
}

function getCarInfoOutside() {
    return this.model + ': ' + this.color;
}

var myCar = new Car('Mercedes Benz', 'Red');
myCar.setCarInfo('Mercedes Benz', 'Black');
console.log(myCar.getCarInfo());
</code></pre>

<pre class="no-style">
  Console log:
   Mercedes Benz: Black

Explanation:
  First we create a function called car that can take two parameters. We initialize two variables which
  were passed as parameters to our "class" when creating instance of it with keyword <b><i>new</i></b>. Initializing
  model and car variables with keyword <b><i>this</i></b> makes them member variables of our "class".
  Then we create two methods and I intentionally made other method <b>outside</b> of the "class"
  declaration and second one inside the "class" declaration. After creating object from "class",
  we decide to change the color of the car to Black instead of Red and finally we use method
  <i>getCarInfoOutside()</i> and pass it's return value to browsers console.

   		<span>
			With ES6 there are keywords and syntax to write classes even if they are not classes in the same sense that in other
			scripting/programming languages. If you are familiar with C++ or JAVA for example, this code snippet should look familiar:
		</span>

<pre><code>class Car {
    constructor(model = 'lada', color = 'red') {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    set setModel(model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    get getModel() {
        return this.model;
    }
}

class Mercedes extends Car {
    constructor() {
        super('Mercedes Benz');
        this.motor = "V4";
    }

    showMyCar() {
        console.log('I am driving a ' + this.color + ' ' + this.model + ' with ' + this.motor + 
                    ' engine');
    }

    static writeToConsole() {
        console.log('Static method called');
    }
}

var myCar = new Mercedes();   // Create new instance of Mercedes that is a sub-class of Car
myCar.setModel = 'Ferrari';   // Use setter method
myCar.showMyCar();            // Write to console: I am driving a red Ferrari with V4 engine
Mercedes.writeToConsole();    // Example of static method
</code></pre>

		<span class="chapter-section-title">Things to remember with JavaScript classes</span>

		<span>
			&bull; The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript<br />
			&bull; Classes are not hoisted<br />
			&bull; The body of the class is executed in strict mode<br />
			&bull; Keyword super can only be used in class constructor and must be called before keyword this can be used
